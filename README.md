# E20-Daily-Journal

## Overview

#### Before serving this please repo please create a journalEntires.json file and input below starter json data. The website needs to reference a pre-determiend set of moods in order for it to function properly. Once you have your basic journalEntires.json file created - serve it to port #8088 using json-server on your local machine and then also serve this repo to any local port that is not #8088!
